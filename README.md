# [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) Docker Stack with JavaScript Support

This Dockerfile will extend the [jupyter/minimal-notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) docker image by adding the [IJavaScript](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/blob/master/README.md) kernel.

Instructions to run a container from this image are the same as for jupyter/minimal-notebook.
